Description: `chemboxR` is a package for molecular information calculator based 
    on empirical formulas of chemicals in raw text. It is designed to 
    intelligently process text input containing the chemical formula and provide 
    associated information on the inquired molecule. It is able to provide the 
    molar mass, check a formula's validity, and provide a balanced combustion 
    equation if the input is combustible. This tool can be utilized for various 
    educational and research purposes for simple and fast information retrieval.
