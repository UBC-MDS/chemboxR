## Introduction

`chemboxR` is a package for molecular information calculator based on
empirical formulas of chemicals in raw text. It is designed to
intelligently process text input containing the chemical formula and
provide associated information on the inquired molecule. It is able to
provide the molar mass, check a formulaâ€™s validity, and provide a
balanced combustion equation if the input is combustible. This tool can
be utilized for various educational and research purposes for simple and
fast information retrieval.

## Installation

You can install the development version of chemboxR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
